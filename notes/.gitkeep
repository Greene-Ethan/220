print()
input()
eval()
* + - / // **
def my_function():
my_function()
Special characters:
\n = print on next line
\t = prints a uniform tab
end = "yadda yadda" prints things on the same line
name, age = eval(input("hello!\nenter your name and age!"))
print("good to see you",name,"you are",age)
loops = run same bit of code over and over
for loops = "definite" = once it gets to this point it knows how many times it'll loop
for variable_here in sequence:
    <body>
Everything in body loops as many times as you want
sequence = [1, 2, 3]
each time the variable goes through the sequence it equals the value of the sequence
range() = a sequence of numbers of which you can specify which numbers you want.
range(10) = produces numbers 0-1
// = integer division
type() = check the type of a data type
% =modular arithmetic: gives remainders of division ex: 5 % 3 = remainder of 2
abs = finds the absolute value of a variable
math.py = use import.math to load module
use math. to list each math function you can use in a module
range(1, 10) = starts range at 1 ends it at 10
range(3, 10, 2) = (start, stop, step) step = count by number
range(10, 3, -1) = count from ten down to 3
accumulator pattern : accumulates results
